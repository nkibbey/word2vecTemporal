# Parse
This is where I do fun java stuff and have a few maven projects

```
corporacleaner/     -> go to if you want to lemmatize text
modelparser/        -> go to if you want to put a model into a w2vdb
pairwisediseases/   -> go to if you want to find out cool stuff like cosine histories using your w2vdb
PubmedYearBasedAbstractParser.java  -> name is fairly intuitive except its not an abs. class abs is literally an article abstract
W2VModelToTable.java                -> should be what is in modelparser but testing on my computer vs aws is interesting
```
