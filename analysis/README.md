# Analysis (python)
I didn't know how much I was going to use python so these are some starter things

```
cosinedb.py	        -> numpy to compare cosine similarity
dimreduc.py	        -> t-sne for model to 2d
retrofit.py	        -> from another project if you want to massage already made vectors https://github.com/mfaruqui/retrofitting
slow_w2v_example.py	-> numpy implementation of w2v also 70x slower
w2vTools.py         -> when I was using python to connect to my db
```
